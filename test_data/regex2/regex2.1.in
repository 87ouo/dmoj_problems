The Society for the Prevention of Profanity on the Internet has realized that
many people were able to circumvent their censorship system by using special
characters. For example, "four" is a four letter word that needs to be
censored, however, people will put it at the end of a sentence, as in "four.",
and the censorship system breaks apart. Another case where it breaks apart
is when people try to use 1337 speak, such as "l33t" or "1337".
