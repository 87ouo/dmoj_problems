The Society for the Prevention of Profanity on the Internet has realized ****
**** people **** **** to circumvent their censorship system by using special
characters. For example, "****" is a **** letter **** **** needs to be
censored, however, people **** put it at the end of a sentence, as in "****.",
and the censorship system breaks apart. Another **** where it breaks apart
is **** people try to use **** speak, **** as "****" or "****".
